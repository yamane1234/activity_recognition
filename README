Process 6-axis data, which is the sum of 3 axes of Hip and 3 axes of Wrist.
Note that if there is an axis with all zero values, the features.py calculation will produce an error.
In that case, that part is skipped during calculation.

-File preparation
1.Copy the original file to create a file named raw. 
eg) cp MOS2E04200322RAW.csv raw
2.Edit file.sh 
3.Edit date.py
4.Edit prepare.sh
5.sh file.sh
6.Repeat the process 1 - 5 for wrist data
7.Combine hip and wrist
eg) paste -d "," MOS2E04200322RAW-edited2.csv MOS2E02200126RAW-edited2.csv > 1003_V1R3XP_4RAW.csv 
If you find , delete it by using sed command. 
8.Edit the file created in step 7 to add information such as the start date and time of measurement and the end time. 

-Preparation of Time_Input_GT3X_Plus_Hip2.csv 
1.Create a table of measurement time in Excel and save it as csv.
2.Delete unnecessary parts.
eg) cut -d "," -f 1-21 Time_Input_GT3X_Plus_Hip2.csv > t
mv t Time_Input_GT3X_Plus_Hip2.csv 

-Calculation of features
0.Copy a file from Not-Processed/ to the current directory.
1.Edit extract-test.sh
2.Edit time.py
3.Edit extract.py
4.Edit iqr.py
5.Edit arc_p4.py
6.sh extract-test.sh (Cut out data and calculate features)

-Integrate features 
1.Edit choose.sh
2.sh choose.sh (integrate features)

-Machine learning (input features calculated above) 
1.Edit random-forest-onehot.py
Set the processing range (line 29 and 43) 
2.Edit cross-validation.sh
3.sh cross-validation.sh (machine learning (cross validation))
(4. sh importance.sh (evaluate the importance of each feature. check importance.csv))

-Classify into 10 classes 
1:changing clothes
2:sitting 
3:standing
4:supine 
5:others
6:brushing teeth 
7:moving luggage 
8:going up/downstairs
